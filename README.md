## Notes

While making the website, javascript with the biggest challegned. It was confusing at first to wrap your head around arrow functions, weird ? conditions, and spread operators. However arrow functions can be used quite similar to loops in python. It was hard to know if functions are correct, the online resources were really helpful in making innerHTML with template literals.
